## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size. It has one breakpoint using media queries, so it's tablet/mobile view and then desktop and above view.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got some practice with CSS grid, changing the layout depending on the size of the viewport. I tried to keep the code as vanilla as possible, since I'm trying to get a good grasp of the basics before adding any frameworks or libraries to it. 

### Continued development

In my next few projects I would like to start adding some JavaScript and maybe some pre-processor for CSS, like SASS.
